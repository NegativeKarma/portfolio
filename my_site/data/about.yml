- name: About my previous work
  description: Graduated in Digital Media at Hyper Island, Stockholm.
   Moved to New York to work for an year and then arrived in Amsterdam because of love and opportunities.
   During my time in Amsterdam I founded Limoney, a crowdfunding platform that I built from scratch together with my colleague and friend Giuseppe.
   Once the platform was up and running, me and two other colleagues decided to start a digital agency in Florence.
   You can check what I did down here.
