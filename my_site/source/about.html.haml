  I'm currently a student at Craft Academy, I want to be able to create applications and modern sites.
  I'm an italian from Florence that recently moved to Gothenburg.
  I decided to extend my knowledge about digital projects by joining craftacademy.
  I'm currently in medias res of my course, fighting, struggling and learning new things about coding everyday.
